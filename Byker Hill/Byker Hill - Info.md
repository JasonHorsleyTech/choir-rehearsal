### Byker High Pit Mine

Byker was a high pit mine located in the Newcastle district of Byker.[4] Although no records survive of any mine called "Walker Shore," Walker Collier owned several pits in the neighboring district of Walker.[5] One theory suggests that "Walker Shore" was thus named or nicknamed by reason of its being coastal and extending out under the North Sea;[6] this seems unlikely, as the district is situated ten kilometers inland from the coast. However, some of Walker's pits lay quite close to the river Tyne, so the name may be a reference to the river shore.
